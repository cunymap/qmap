## **Project Scope :**
#### Creating a website that will allow a student to view the most successful course path to graduating quickly
Ensure project is scalable to all cuny<br>
Include data from several QC majors<br>
Include login and accounts for admin and sysadmin, public access for students<br>
Support admins in adding graduation maps to system<br>
Implement API to connect frontend and backend<br>
Create working website for user interface<br>
Create working backend to process data<br>
Implement ability to read relevant data from databases<br>


## **Project Technologys:**
- Frontend
    - HTML5
    - ReactJS
    - Bootstrap<br>
    - Complement HTML5up.net website template with Bootstrap/Materlize.css<br>
	- Future Iteration: use jquery and reactjs frontend<br>
- Backend
    - Python
    - MySQL
- Infrastructure
    - Github
    - CircleCI
    - Venus

## **Project Data Need:**
All data should be in a format that can be read using MySQL<br>
CRSE_CATALOG<br>
CRSE_OFFER<br>
Major requirements for all included majors, seperated by college<br>
Graduation requirements for all included colleges (including what gen eds are required, and how many credits are required)<br>
How many credits each course is worth<br>

## **Project Milestones:**
1. **9/12** - Assignment
2. **9/17** - Allocate Teams, implement codebase in github, implement projects in github, enforce project roadmap for each team
3. **10/24** - Complete setup of codebase, using roadmap and wireframes, implement a dummy website not connected to backend that will display static data for UX, backend implement python and mysql platform and have test functions to ensure data integration is working, also setup deployment pipeline and system backend for UX testing. By this point in the project we should have our codebase defined, our roadmap of features set forth, and a website with a landing page, that will have some clickable elements that show some static, potentially irrelevant data just to show proof of concept. On the backend we should have some concept functions that can run basic queries to ensure we are able to establish platform database connectivity, as well as the feature roadmap for integrations to the backend(eg, with frontend) also as a proof of concept for how the rest of the platform development process will be going and the skeleton for the direction it will be taking
4. **11/21** - Ensure pipeline is capable of deploying autonomously, have frontend integration with backend established and begin roadmap for feature additions. By this point we should have a wireframe of the website available that has some basic navigation and can return some queued data from the backend directly via the site. This step is to show where the teams should be focusing on their integration with each other, so that can be kept in mind when working on features, that will be fleshing out the UI and more accurately controlling the platform's datasets
5. **12/12** - Ensure all new features are successful and submit working project
